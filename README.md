The objective of the game is to collect crystals. The crystals each have a number, however, the number is a secret unless you click on the crystal.

We will guess a number and you will collect crystals and add the numbers that are revealed. The goal is to have the numbers on the crystals add up to the number that we guessed.

If your total is higher than our number, you lose. If your number equals our number, you win. So basically it's BlackJack, but with crystals.

Have fun and good luck! Also, you don't need to do any math, the computer will do the math for you!
